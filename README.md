# Scripting-Project
Repository for Scripting 7180 Final Project

## Brief PSA
The reproducible part of this project is a small group of sample data that is being utilized to showcase the overall jist of the scripts and their purposes. My actual project involves over 3200 whole genome sequences and has way too much data for GitHub to handle. For the sake of explanations, I will provide a walkthrough for the example files and provide further details into the actual project I am producing outside of this class. I will provide a file with the final outputs from the larger project in its own directory. While it may not have much to do with the outputs that should be achieved from the the class project, it gives insight into how much can be done with the Admixture program in a research setting. All of the work I produced was done with the help of the Auburn University HPC Easley Cluster, which allowed for all of these large amount of data to be processed. Do not worry, the example files are simply run on a home computer!


## Downloads
To download the packages for Admixture, go to https://dalexander.github.io/admixture/download.html - the package options come in Linux and MacOSX versions.

To download R Studio and R, all packages and versions can be found at https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

To download the software packages for Plink, please visit https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/ - utilize whichever of the "Stable" binary downloads apply to your operating system. I used Plink 1.9 for this example. In my actual project, I utilize both versions 1.9 and 2.0. (You can just download version 1.9).

## Purpose of This Project and Overview of Scripts/Packages
The goal of this project is to run population based ancestry analysis on samples to see what percentage of their makeup comes from different populations. 

This prjoect will showcase three different scripts that will be written in bash (2 scripts) and R (1 script) formats. The scripts will be named starting with a number. The numbers indicate the correct order in which to use the scripts through the project.
